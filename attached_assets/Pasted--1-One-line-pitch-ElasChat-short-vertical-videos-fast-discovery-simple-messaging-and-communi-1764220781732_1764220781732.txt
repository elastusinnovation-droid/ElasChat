7 — UX microcopy (examples)

	•	Empty feed: “Nothing here yet. Follow creators or explore Discover.”
	•	Post success: “Your video was posted!”
	•	Follow confirmation: “You’re now following @username”

8 — Simple data model (starter)

Entities:
	•	User { id, username, displayName, bio, avatarUrl, followersCount, followingCount, privacySetting }
	•	Video { id, userId, videoUrl, coverUrl, caption, hashtags[], soundId, likesCount, commentsCount, createdAt, privacy }
	•	Comment { id, videoId, userId, text, likesCount, createdAt }
	•	Like { id, userId, targetId(type:video/comment), createdAt }
	•	Message { id, fromUserId, toUserId, content(type:text/video), createdAt }

9 — Basic tech suggestions (fast MVP)
	•	Backend: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage) for MVP — simple to integrate for auth, storing video metadata, and hosting videos on Cloud Storage + signed URLs.
	•	Realtime: Firestore listeners for feed updates and messages.
	•	Video processing: encode uploads on serverless function (Cloud Functions) to generate web-optimized mp4 + thumbnails.
	•	Push notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging.
	•	Client: React Native (Expo) or native iOS/Android. For fastest start use React Native + Expo managed workflow (but note native video features may need custom modules).
	•	Moderation: automated profanity filter + manual reviews, reporting flag in UX.

10 — Privacy & safety (must have)
	•	Option to make account private.
	•	Report and block on every profile and content card.
	•	Parental / age gate: require birthdate, block age-restricted features under 13 (or follow local law).
	•	Terms & Community Guidelines link at signup.

11 — Example Figma frame names & copy ready to paste
	•	Home / For You — TopTabs: Following | For You | Nearby — Feed: VideoCard

	•	Record — Buttons: Flash | Flip | Timer — Record CTA: Hold to record
	•	Edit / Post — Fields: Caption..., Add hashtags, Tag people, Who can view this? (Public/Friends/Private) — CTA: Post

12 — Launch checklist (MVP)
	1.	Auth flows (email, phone, social)
	2.	Video upload + playback (webm/mp4 for mobile)
	3.	Vertical feed with infinite scroll (cursor pagination)
	4.	Like/comment/share basics
	5.	Record + basic editing + music attach
	6.	Profiles + follow/unfollow
	7.	Messages (1:1)
	8.	Notifications + basic moderation
	9.	Analytics (events: post, like, follow, share)
	10.	App store listing assets (screenshots, short promo video)

13 — Optional cool extras to add later
